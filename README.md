# Linked-List-Database-Example
Suppose you have been tasked with writing a Python program (using linked lists) to keep track of the students in our Department. Data for each student includes their StudentID, Last Name, First Name, Major, Number of Completed Hours, and CumulativeGPA. Your program should complete the following tasks:  allow the user to add a student to the end of the list  allow the user to search for a student and change his/her major  compute and display the number of students in each classification  print (to an output file named &lt;yourLastName>Classifications.txt) the names and majors of all students by classification.
